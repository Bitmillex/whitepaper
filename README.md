# The Whitepaper
## The Background
From a peak in 2016 of around $200B total market capitalization, to a peak of over $900B in 2017, the fact that decentralized currencies are real and here to stay, needs not much debate.  A wave which started in January 2009 when Satoshi Nakamoto mined the genesis block, has under a decade led to the creation of over 1500 coins and tokens with the number rising daily. With daily average of $15 billion worth of cryptocurrencies passing through exchanges by December 2017, with exchanges charging an average of 0.1% fee, it follows that over $15m is earned on coin and token exchange alone, excluding other fees like withdrawal, margin trade charges etc.
### The Opportunity
Against this backdrop, and as the revolution sweeps on, the cryptocurrency community grows every day, more coins/tokens are being created with cryptocurrency exchanges struggling to keep up. Infrastructure and technology put in place by exchanges can no longer accommodate the rising wave, leading to site crashes and security breaches resulting in losses amounting to billions of dollars.
With almost every big exchange having been affected in one way or the other, needing to make frantic upgrades to their existing facilities and resources, coupled with a change in the demand pattern of cryptocurrency traders, it needs no saying that this is the time to step in and take advantage of this opportunity by bridging the gap between what traders' desire and what is currently available.
### More Opportunity
Apart from challenges with accommodating volume, most of the existing exchanges have not satisfied the needs and aspirations of traders and investors.  With majority of these exchanges running as small, underfunded units with limited resources, the industry focus has largely been on the conventional services of registration, deposit, buy, sell and withdrawal, leaving a void that needs to be filled.
 
 # What is Bitmillex?
 Bitmillex is the next generation cryptocurrency exchange that aims at taking advantage of the opportunities presented in the cryptocurrency exchange space, addressing the areas of deficiencies identified in current exchanges and providing a solution to the specific needs of traders and investors.
The idea of the Bitmillex project was conceived in 2016 when a group of traders who met during the New York Trading Show, opened discussions and analyses on the gaps between what was desired by traders in the rapidly rising cryptocurrency space as opposed to what was actually provided by exchanges. The plan was initially to leverage on the experience of the founders and develop a model to operate as a crypto advisory, hedge fund management and to invest in pool mining. The project was then named the Coolima Invest forum. However around mid-2017, as a result of further surveys and events it was agreed that the group focus be redirected to using the project as a vehicle to address more pointedly, the challenges and problems identified in the cryptocurrency Exchange industry by developing a platform that will not only win the trust of investors, but offer a completely new dimension to exchanging.  The team consequently agreed to adopt a new name Bitmillex.
