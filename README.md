# The Whitepaper
## The Background
From a peak in 2016 of around $200B total market capitalization, to a peak of over $900B in 2017, the fact that decentralized currencies are real and here to stay, needs not much debate.  A wave which started in January 2009 when Satoshi Nakamoto mined the genesis block, has under a decade led to the creation of over 1500 coins and tokens with the number rising daily. With daily average of $15 billion worth of cryptocurrencies passing through exchanges by December 2017, with exchanges charging an average of 0.1% fee, it follows that over $15m is earned on coin and token exchange alone, excluding other fees like withdrawal, margin trade charges etc.
### The Opportunity
Against this backdrop, and as the revolution sweeps on, the cryptocurrency community grows every day, more coins/tokens are being created with cryptocurrency exchanges struggling to keep up. Infrastructure and technology put in place by exchanges can no longer accommodate the rising wave, leading to site crashes and security breaches resulting in losses amounting to billions of dollars.
With almost every big exchange having been affected in one way or the other, needing to make frantic upgrades to their existing facilities and resources, coupled with a change in the demand pattern of cryptocurrency traders, it needs no saying that this is the time to step in and take advantage of this opportunity by bridging the gap between what traders' desire and what is currently available.
### More Opportunity
Apart from challenges with accommodating volume, most of the existing exchanges have not satisfied the needs and aspirations of traders and investors.  With majority of these exchanges running as small, underfunded units with limited resources, the industry focus has largely been on the conventional services of registration, deposit, buy, sell and withdrawal, leaving a void that needs to be filled.
 
 # What is Bitmillex?
 Bitmillex is the next generation cryptocurrency exchange that aims at taking advantage of the opportunities presented in the cryptocurrency exchange space, addressing the areas of deficiencies identified in current exchanges and providing a solution to the specific needs of traders and investors.
The idea of the Bitmillex project was conceived in 2016 when a group of traders who met during the New York Trading Show, opened discussions and analyses on the gaps between what was desired by traders in the rapidly rising cryptocurrency space as opposed to what was actually provided by exchanges. The plan was initially to leverage on the experience of the founders and develop a model to operate as a crypto advisory, hedge fund management and to invest in pool mining. The project was then named the Coolima Invest forum. However around mid-2017, as a result of further surveys and events it was agreed that the group focus be redirected to using the project as a vehicle to address more pointedly, the challenges and problems identified in the cryptocurrency Exchange industry by developing a platform that will not only win the trust of investors, but offer a completely new dimension to exchanging.  The team consequently agreed to adopt a new name Bitmillex.

# Our Mission
To become one of the top 3 cryptocurrency exchanges in the world by offering a wide range of premium trading and investment solutions on a one-stop platform and winning the trust and confidence of investors. To achieve this, we shall invest in nothing but the best and most advanced systems and technologies,while making continuous upgrades to our systems and processes.

# Our Core Values
## Flexibility
## Trust
## Scalability
## Security

"Our desire is to make crypto asset and fiat currency switch as seamless as possible within the most social and friendly trading environment... "

# Our Solutions
## Most Secured Crypto Currency Exchange:
Our aim is to make Bitmillex the world's most secure cryptocurrency exchange where traders do not have to lose sleep over the safety of their funds.  Our wallets shall be totally fool-proof and secured. To ensure this, we know it is paramount to invest in the very best underlying technology.
As part of efforts to achieve our objective, the Bitmillex Exchange shall primarily be hosted in the cloud, in partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS).  Custom built security layers to be deployed include the AWS Identity and Access  Management (IAM), Cloud computing, Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). We  are particularly excited about the EC2 because  it gives a room for scalability. This is one of the big deficiencies that have seen some of the largest industry players shut new members registration as they could not easily expand their capacity base.
## Multiple Servers with H.S.M Integration:
Not only shall we host on dedicated cloud services, our server system will be based on failsafe, state of the art architecture.  The failsafe server shall be built with instant auto switch capabilities in case of any disaster. Unlike most exchanges, our servers shall be connected to custom-built Hardware Security Modules (HSM) to safeguard and manage cryptographic keys as well as provide secure execution of critical codes.
We shall deploy master-slave database replication, load balancer (reverse proxy) as well as customized http accelerator (cache proxy) to maximize performance efficiency by distributing the workload across  multiple servers.
In addition to these, A very holistic approach shall be adopted to protect against internal attacks and vulnerability exposures. Measures being put in place here Include role separation, multiple signatures, least privilege precaution, environment credential isolation, component isolation, circuit breakers, alerting system, real time visualization and monitoring, DDOS protection, use of atomic transition, sanity checking and back up automation.
## Vulnerability Tests:
Our goal is zero tolerance for security weaknesses and to achieve this, we are pleased to announce that we have reached agreements with world #1 hackerpowered security platform, HackerOne, to maintain a continuous vulnerability testing and rectification partnership with Bitmillex. The deal will give Bitmillex access from launch, to the over 100,000 cybersecurity researchers on HackerOne's network, constantly checking for software bugs with a view to having them pro-actively eliminated before any breach may occur. 
## Bitmillex 2:98 Strategy:
As an additional safety measure, at every given time, no more than 2% of the total Bitcoin and all compatible coins and tokens will be held online. 98% shall be maintained in custom built offline cold wallets. To achieve this seamlessly, a self-balancing mechanism is being set up to automatically transfer out excesses and transfer in deficiencies between both storages, upon due authorization process. The 2% is maintained to handle the liquidity requirement of the exchange at every given time.
## The Most Advanced Trading Engine:
The matching engine is the core software component of an electronic exchange. Matching engines use algorithms to allocate users' trades, matching bids with offers on stop and limit bases. We are building what will be the Exchange industry's largest and fastest trading engine capable of processing 2,200,000 orders per second, at least 50% more than what can be currently found on the biggest exchanges. By being customized to connect to, and aggregate liquidity from the top exchanges in the industry through API links, this C++ Programmed engine guarantees that not only shall our users enjoy the most competitive prices, but also that no orders can ever be stuck, and execution shall go through in microseconds.
## Auto Trade Features:
Bitmillex is introducing an auto trade feature based on the premises of copy trading. It enables users to switch their accounts to Auto-Trade Mode after selecting which of the signal providers* on our pool, they wish to follow. A very powerful trading method which works by automatically copying all trades from the provider's account, onto the subscribers'. 
This feature is being customized to give users the liberty and flexibility to specify how much of their total wallet balance they wish to commit to the auto-trade scheme and further sub-allocate committed amount to follow up to 
9
three separate providers at once. From inception, minimum amount a copier can commit to the auto-trade system will be fixed at 0.2 BTC. Maximum to allocate to a single provider shall be 5 BTC, subject to future limit reviews. At any given time, a copier may decide to close a particular copied trade or completely unfollow a provider. Providers are entitled to 10% of the profits made on copied trades.
 
By default, trades under the auto trade system shall be opened with a 30% stop loss activated. Users may however manually adjust stop losses according to their individual risk appetites. A minimum of 10% and a maximum of 90% exposure limit per provider is allowable. Note that the stop loss limits are not set per individual trade but on total amount committed to each provider. 
## Free Trade Signal service to members:
We shall offer trade signals to all members using a combination of artificial and human intelligence. We are bringing to the Bitmillex platform, the output of a research which started over 14 months by two of our lead developers who developed and tested auto signal generating  bots, based on Python and Curl technology generating over $11.75m of trading income within the test period. In addition to this, we shall maintain an analysis center from where our team of seasoned analysts shall also generate signals from fundamental and technical analyses.
## Peer to Peer Lending
Another first by Bitmillex, a social lending system that is aimed at redirecting interests earned on margin trading from institutions and putting it in the hands of investors. It works by bringing together traders with a higher risk appetite or who want to invest more than their account balances can accommodate and hence want to trade on borrowed funds; and those who want to lend out their idle or unused funds.  In effect, a form of margin trading system funded by other traders' funds
To borrow, prospective borrower “applies” for funds. This is matched with funds “Offered” for lending by prospective lenders.
Borrower-lending matching is system automated on first come, first served basis. Lending rates to be applied are algorithm generated on a daily basis.  The borrower's equity forms a stop-loss cover for all trades executed under this arrangement, making it completely risk-free for lenders.
## The first full time cryptocurrency exchange to offer trading on MT4/MT5 charting software:
 As the popular saying goes “a day trader is only as good as his charting software” While a few may find that saying debatable, it is our belief at Bitmillex that a key part of a trader's job – like a radiologist's – involves interpreting data on a screen.  And that is why we are offering to the cryptocurrency trading community, one of the most advanced charting software, the Meta Trader 5. This we will make available on PC, desktop, IOS and android mobile devices as an alternative to the chartson our exchange platform. A few of the key features of MT5 include
* Margin trading and full support for long (buy) and short (sell) positioning, making it possible for our traders to benefit and profit from not only bull, but also bear markets. 
* Fully supports algorithm trading which enables automated trading using bots. Making it possible to run our developed bots seamlessly. Traders may also run their own customized programmes
* A full arsenal of analytical tools for the most thorough price analysis and forecasting.
* Over 100 charts can be opened at once to enable easy monitoring of as many pairs as possible
* Over 80 built in technical indicators with room to add customized ones
## Offer Forex Majors
In addition to cryptocurrency trading, we shall offer trading of forex majors starting with EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY, USD/CAD. Along with this feature is an option to store funds in fiat (USD). The rationale for this, is to give traders and investors an option and flexibility especially for the crypto “red days” 
## Integration of On-Platform Peer to Peer Trading of BTC 
As an alternative to making deposits from external sources, from a section of the Bitmillex platform, users can buy BTC and Ethereum with which they will trade on the platform, from other users and sell same. Payment means to be deployed include paypal, credit and debit card, direct deposits and transfer to bank accounts, Skrill, Neteller, Western Union as well as other digital currencies.
## The BitMillex Debit Card:
The Most Complete and secured  Exchange in the world cannot be said to be really complete without having a means for users to easily and conveniently spend directly from their wallets. The Solution- Bitmillex Instant Debit card. The Usage of debit cards in cryptocurrency  is not exactly new. However what makes ours unique is the speed of transaction made possible by the introduction D.A.U.E (Drawing Against Unconfirmed Effect). At Bitmillex, we shall maintain a clearing pool to give immediate value when our users top up their debit cards to access fiat at ATMs or POS. Rather than waste precious time for transfer confirmation on the blockchain, the action initiating the top-up triggers a blockchain signal to user's cryptocurrency wallet to confirm if the wallet is adequately funded. If the response comes out positive, rate conversions are done, top up amount is “blocked”, and instant fiat value is given to the debit card in a total time of less than 30 seconds. With JSON API support from Open Exchange Rates, we shall offer the most transparent, competitive and friendly conversion rates based on data collected and blended from multiple reliable providers. 
## Bitmillex Decentrex
Establishment of a fully decentralized exchange also with unique features; in 2019 to support all ethereum tokens.
## Lowest Fees
we are offering the lowest fees in the industry. Over 50% less than industry average and will at times be free when trading on BTML market. 
## 24/7 Real Time Customer Service
Unlike services offered on most exchanges, we shall operate a 24 hours, 7days a week responsive customer service unit to respond to clients in all major languages.
## User Interface Preview
Note: Web Interface Images taken from alpha test simulated with dummy data. Final user interface may come with slight modifications

# BTML
The Bitmillex Token (BTML) is the dedicated cryptocurrency of the Bitmillex Exchange. A decentralized ethereum based token with a maximum quantity of 75,000,000 units.
As an ERC-20 smart Token, the BTML shall be easily transferable between users on the EthereumBlockchain
To increase the demand and consequently, the value of BTML tokens, certain Exchange offerings will be made exclusive to BTML Token holders. Such offerings include Auto Trade Option, Minimal Transaction Charges and the free trade signals.
Also, when the Bitmillex Decentralized Exchange for ethereum tokens commences in Q1 2019, BTML shall be used for GAS. 
50% of Bitmillexnet annual revenue will be payable in a dividend model to holders of at least 1000 units of BTML tokens at the end of every financial year starting from 2019.
We have added an interesting feature to the BTML which is uncommon with exchange coins and tokens; it will be listed on two of the biggest external exchanges and the reasons for this are:
* To create a positive effect on the token price by increasing demand 
* To create more users for our services from external exchanges as the token can only best be put to use when you trade on the Bitmillex exchange
*  In line with our core value of flexibility rather than rigidity
## The BTML Buy Back Plan
From Q1 2019, after the launch of the Bitmillex Decentralex, 75% of net income on ICO listing services and 30% of new coin/token listing fees will be used to repurchase BTML tokens and burn them. Our plan is to have not more than 50m BTML tokens (including reserves) available by Q1 2021
The plan shall work like this: Users who desire ICO listing services on our platform will be required to pay in BTML which effectively means buying BTML from the exchange and paying us with it. 75% of the BTML tokens received under this scheme shall be burnt under a transparent and verifiable arrangement. Also 30% of income directly earned on new coin listings will be used to purchase BTML from the exchange and destroyed in the same process.
## The ICO
A total of 50,000,000 BTML Tokens shall be offered via an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) The offering shall begin with a Private Pre-Sale which opens in March 2018 to be followed by Pre-ICO and Public ICO after. Soft cap is set at $1.5m and hard cap at $10m
