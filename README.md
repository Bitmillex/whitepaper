# The Whitepaper
## The Background
From a peak in 2016 of around $200B total market capitalization, to a peak of over $900B in 2017, the fact that decentralized currencies are real and here to stay, needs not much debate.  A wave which started in January 2009 when Satoshi Nakamoto mined the genesis block, has under a decade led to the creation of over 1500 coins and tokens with the number rising daily. With daily average of $15 billion worth of cryptocurrencies passing through exchanges by December 2017, with exchanges charging an average of 0.1% fee, it follows that over $15m is earned on coin and token exchange alone, excluding other fees like withdrawal, margin trade charges etc.
### The Opportunity
Against this backdrop, and as the revolution sweeps on, the cryptocurrency community grows every day, more coins/tokens are being created with cryptocurrency exchanges struggling to keep up. Infrastructure and technology put in place by exchanges can no longer accommodate the rising wave, leading to site crashes and security breaches resulting in losses amounting to billions of dollars.
With almost every big exchange having been affected in one way or the other, needing to make frantic upgrades to their existing facilities and resources, coupled with a change in the demand pattern of cryptocurrency traders, it needs no saying that this is the time to step in and take advantage of this opportunity by bridging the gap between what traders' desire and what is currently available.
### More Opportunity
Apart from challenges with accommodating volume, most of the existing exchanges have not satisfied the needs and aspirations of traders and investors.  With majority of these exchanges running as small, underfunded units with limited resources, the industry focus has largely been on the conventional services of registration, deposit, buy, sell and withdrawal, leaving a void that needs to be filled.
